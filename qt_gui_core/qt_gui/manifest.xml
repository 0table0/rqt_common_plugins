  <description brief="Integrated graphical user interface">
    qt_gui provides the infrastructure for an integrated graphical user interface based on Qt.
    It is extensible with Python- and C++-based plugins (implemented in separate packages) which can contribute arbitrary widgets.
    It requires either PyQt or PySide bindings.
    The code API of qt_gui (except the exposed interfaces for plugins) is not stable, so it is not recommended for use in other tools.
